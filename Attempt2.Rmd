# Visualizing the relationship between the continuous variables and the outcome to assess linearity

# Histspike bins the continuous x variable into equal-width bins and then computes and plots the frequency counts of Y within each bin. The function then displays the proportions as a vertical histogram with a loess curve fit to the plot.The loess nonparametric smoother is an excellent tool for determining the shape of the relationship between a predictor and the response

# datadist function computes statistical summaries of predictors to  automate 
# estimation and plotting of effects
